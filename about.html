	            <h1>You're always welcome at JJ's Diner</h1>
	                <p class="blue">JJ's Diner has been a restaurant staple for the citizens of Pawnee since its opening in 1976. If you're looking to eat healthy, this is NOT the place for you. We deep fry, sugar coat, and bacon wrap everything. We are owned by JJ Lipscomb and are run by JJ and his family. We are located at 122 Sunderland, between TrampStamp Tattoos and the ChloroTech Cadmium Refinery.</p>

	                <p class="blue">Looking to spot some local celebrities? Area political figures like Leslie Knope and Ron Swanson frequent here to get their waffle fix, and popular television faces like Joan Calamezzo and Pert Happly refuel after a long day with our delicious coffee and cronuts. </p>
	                <p class="blue">We are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to meet all of your dining needs. No reservations needed, and if you don't want to sit and eat with us, we can package up a delicious meal for you to go. Don't see what you want on the menu? We do custom orders as well! Want us to feed your office or party? We cater! Nothing says party time like pounds and pounds of deep fried waffles.</p>
